# Collection of generic style components

Any file here exports a default **Glitz styled component** which should be used instead of JSX built-in components like `<ul>`. It's recommended to use these site-wide to ensure consistency, but also keep in mind that these may be used to replace HTML-content created by e.g. editors using WYSIWYG.

If the default exported component can receive props, the component without props is what you should expect as an editor.
